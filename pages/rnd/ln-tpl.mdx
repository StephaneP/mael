Hi,

Thanks for reaching out and connecting!

Unfortunately I'm not actively looking for a new role at this time, but it would be good to stay connected for the future when I am looking for my next role.

If you have any full stack or lead roles working with anything JavaScript (TypeScript/Node/React/React Native, etc), that come up after a few months, please feel free to reach out in the future.

Hi,

Thanks for reaching out and connecting!

The opportunity sounds interesting, and it sounds like I match a lot of the knowledge and skills you're looking for.

However just so things are clear, I can't seem to find a range relating to the compensation for the role - and currently I am only considering opportunities that pay a base salary at a very minimum Â£X0,000 per annum, as well as being remote.

Can you let me know how this fits in with your expectations for the role please?
