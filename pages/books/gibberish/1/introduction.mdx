# Who am I

Hey, I'm Matt, I'm a developer at Threads Styling currently, and I've been solving problems with code since 2015. During lockdown a lot of my friends wanted to learn to code, and I referred them to a number of resources, good blog posts, udemy courses, etc. But none of the resources each seemed to quite cover enough to include those who had never done any kind of coding at all, or make them able to easily setup a website themselves, without having to try splice together information from a number of different sources, which is a less than stellar great experience, and difficult for a total new comer.

# Who this is for

This book aims to try to cover all the way from not knowing how to code at all, up to the point of being able to make your own website with current modern technologies used in industry, aiming to get you up to the minimum knowledge to start making websites for yourselves, and trying to make you employable as an extremely solid junior.

# What this aims to do

This book will aim to arm you with a wide range of knowledge, setting you up as a jack of all trades. After reading it and working through it, you should have a basic understaying of some practical programming concepts, and should have enough information to create a website with modern technologies used in industry, focusing on heavily on JavaScript and React.

# How it'll try to do it

It will lay out the basics of the concepts, and we'll talk about them, why they are the way they are, when you'll need to use them, and so on, both in plain text, and with some code examples and interactive demos throughout. At certain points later on in the book we'll talk through some mini projects, creating and deploying and setting up some basic websites.
