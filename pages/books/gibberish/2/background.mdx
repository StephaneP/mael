Programming, coding, it's all pretty much the same thing. It's a human (you!) writing out instructions telling the computer what to do, to try to solve some kind of problem. Those instructions we write are called _Computer Programs_, or _Software_, and we write them using _Programming Languages_. _Programming languages_ are a way of writing these instructions in a nicer way, closer to the languages we use to talk to other humans, otherwise we'd have to write all our instructions in 1's and 0's, because computers talk in terms of binary.

Despite the often used term _Computer Science_ etc, writing code is a pretty creative task, most of the time there's no "right" or "wrong" way to solve a problem, similar to how there's no "right" way to paint a picture. You have a number of tools available to you, different brushes and paints, but you can use them in a number of ways to paint the picture. The same is true of code, you have the basic bits of the programming languages give you (called _primitives_), and you put them together in different ways so they solve your problem.
