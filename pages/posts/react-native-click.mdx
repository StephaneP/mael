So here's the story of how I lost a few hours of my life figuring out some issues with some tests.

Outline:

- Explanation of background and discovery of problem
- Explanation of investigation and discovery of react-native-web problem
- Anatomy of a click
- Work around decided on at the time
- Conclude that @testing-library/user-event is best

# Why

Here's some _markdown_ content!

And more

```js:sample.js
function click() {
  console.info("click");
  const test = 32;
  const what = "what";
}
```
