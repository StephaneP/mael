Outline:

- Explanation of background and discovery of problem
- Explanation of investigation and discovery of react-native-web problem
- Anatomy of a click
- Work around decided on at the time
- Conclude that @testing-library/user-event is best

```js:sample.js
function click () {
  console.info('click');
  const test = 32;
  const what = 'what';
}
```
