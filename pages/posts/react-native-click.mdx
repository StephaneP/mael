So here's the story of how I lost a few hours of my life figuring out some issues with some tests.
Over at [Threads Styling](https://www.threadsstyling.com/) we use [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) to write reusable components for both native, and web, using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).
This leads to a pretty sweey setup where we can write our components once and use them where ever we need them.

Together with this we also use [Testing Library's](https://testing-library.com/) [@testing-library/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) to write tests for our browser based applications.

I was

- Explanation of background and discovery of problem
- Explanation of investigation and discovery of react-native-web problem
- Anatomy of a click
- Work around decided on at the time
- Conclude that @testing-library/user-event is best

# Why

Here's some _markdown_ content!

And more

```js:sample.js
function click() {
  console.info("click");
  const test = 32;
  const what = "what";
}
```
