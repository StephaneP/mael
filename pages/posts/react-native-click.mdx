So here's the story of how I lost a few hours of my life figuring out some issues with some tests.
Over at [Threads Styling](https://www.threadsstyling.com/) we use [react-native](https://reactnative.dev/) to write reusable components for both native, and web, using [react-native-web](https://github.com/necolas/react-native-web).
This leads to a pretty sweey setup where we can write our components once and use them where ever we need them.

Together with this we also use [Testing Library's](https://testing-library.com/) [@testing-library/react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@testing-library/react) to write tests for our browser based applications.

Here's some _markdown_ content!

```js:Touchable/index.js
/**
 * Invoked when the item is "selected" - meaning the interaction ended by
 * letting up while the item was either in the state
 * `RESPONDER_ACTIVE_PRESS_IN` or `RESPONDER_INACTIVE_PRESS_IN`.
 *
 * @abstract
 * touchableHandlePress: function

Here's a quick interactive example of a button, and if you click on it it will tell you the events that are fired from it. You can see the source of the example [here](https://github.com/maael/mael/tree/master/components/atoms/EventExample).

<EventExample />

For a click, you should see something like:

- mousedown
- focus
- mouseup
- click

If you're on mobile you'll see some `touchstart` and `touchend` events in there too.

> [icon:ℹ️] I've omitted some events like `mousemove` etc that fire often and aren't that useful for what I'm trying to show.
