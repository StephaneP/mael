1-2-1s are one of those tricky things that you're never taught or told how to do. You kind of have to pick it up as you go along and hope that you're doing it right. And that can suck.

Depending on your company, these can either crop up with varying frequency, I've heard of some places that do weekly 1-2-1s, or some leave it for as long as once per quarter.

From my experience, 1-2-1s are often handled badly, especially when you're new to the industry and haven't had any experience figuring out what they are and what to do in them.

I'll talk over some of the 1-2-1s experiences that I've had, and then I'll finish up with some general thoughts and feelings on them, and what they should look like.

# The 4 Bad 1-2-1 Types

Here's a couple of examples of some bad 1-2-1 types that I've experienced. It's important to know that in part managers are reasonable for these - but I am too. Not knowing how 1-2-1s work doesn't help, but if your 1-2-1s aren't feeling productive to you, it's up to you to try to feed that back to your manager and change that. Of course, mileage can vary with how often this works, depending on the manager and company.

### The Blabbing Manager

This type of 1-2-1 is one where you sit down with your manager, and as soon as you do, your manager goes off on a tangent talking in an almost monologue. Some of the time they can be talking about general business things, or checking up on your work, or some of the time bizarre bits of philosophy. In moderation in a 1-2-1, these can be a good thing, the business/work side of things are good check ups and can give you more context, and the off-topic conversation gives you a chance to network with your manager. However it's not good if this is all the 1-2-1 is, where you don't get to address what you want to, or need to. It's all too easy to lose control of the meeting, especially when you're new, and unfamiliar with the structure of what a good 1-2-1 should be.

### The Awkward Silence

Again, it's all to easy to fall into this type of 1-2-1 if you have no idea on what you should be doing in them. In an ideal world, the manager should take control and steer the 1-2-1, but in my experience, some managers just don't know how to do this - or maybe they have as much as an idea of what a 1-2-1 should be as you do.

### The Shout Down

1-2-1s should be a safe place to share things and concerns with your manager. But sometimes that's just not how it goes. You share something, and your manager instead tries to shout your concerns down, without really talking to you about them. It can be tricky to pick this one out from when they're trying to help you understand reasonably, but it's how they go about it.

### The Self-Review

Both parties should be involved in a 1-2-1, and should be giving their opinions. A lot of the time though, I've had managers focus on just you. Which isn't great for someone who's new, and not sure on what they're doing. You want to hear what your manager has to say on you, your progress, and ideas on what your goals should be. That kind of input is super useful when you're starting out, as it can give you a bit of guidance, and a template to build upon. But some managers hold back on that - maybe they don't want to cloud your own judgements, but ultimately the lack of guidance hurts those new to the process, rather than helping them.

### The Rearranger

1-2-1s are one of those meetings that I think are super important for all involved, but are far too easily swept under the rug and/or postponed. I've lost count of the number of times that I've had a 1-2-1 cancelled or skipped for one reason or another. When this happens regularly, this is a lack of respect for you. It's snubbing your chance to give and get feedback, and to plan out your development.

# What's a good 1-2-1 look like

I've had my fair share of bad 1-2-1s. But I've had some good ones too. With the experiences I've had so far, I've had some feelings on 1-2-1s solidify.

## Try to provide a structure

### List a rough set of topics to address

This can help by giving an idea about what to think about before the meeting itself, and also the extra structure keeps the discussion a lot more focused. Though also ad-hoc comments and things not in the list of topics should be no means be excluded or skipped in favour for staying stricly to the agenda. The 1-2-1 is your chance to talk about what you want to. I'll cover what sort of topics I think should be included in more depth below.

### Set expectations about what will come out of the meeting.

Collaborating and writing down personal development plans/goals are something I'm a fan of, with short term and long term goals. Personal development plans and growth are topics in their own right too, but are an important part of the 1-2-1 process.
