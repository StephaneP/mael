Talk about the importance of documenting discussions and decisions.
- Talk about importance to avoid meeting fatigue.
  - A lot of the time more people are going to be affected by a decision than those with opinions/control of the decision.
- Important to have the legacy so future teams know of the decision made and why, to pass on knowledge and stop fragmented approaches.
- Accommodates people who are ill or miss the discussion/decision for one reason or another, and allows them to still contribute.
