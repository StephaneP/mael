# Introduction

For a recent project of mine, [Majority Plays](), I need to make a small desktop app to run as a tray application.

The basic requirements were to allow the user to do two things:

- Connect/disconnect to "rooms" on the website
- Press the keys voted on by other people on the website.

I also wanted to get it done fast, as I wanted to try to finish the majority of the project in a day after coming up with it.

For speed, I chose to make a quick electron app, as I know JavaScript, and have used Electron before.

I was set up pretty quickly.

However I ran into a problem.

# The problem

The app was essentially just an electron [Menu](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/menu) added to a [Tray](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/tray).

Dead simple, run something like this:

```js:simple_tray_menu.js
```

And :boom:, a tray app with a menu.

However, I wanted to update the items in the menu to reflect the disconnected/connecting/connected states the app can be in while joining a room.

And the `Menu` in electron, is kind of dynamic, but kind of not. [You can set `enabled`, `visble` and `checked` dynamically](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/937#issuecomment-67543939), _but_ [you can't add/remove/update labels of items dynamically](https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/846).

This is a bummer.
