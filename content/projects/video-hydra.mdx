A place to watch as many twitch streams, twitch chats, or youtube videos as you want, however you want. Add items as tiles, and resize them, drag and drop them, however you want. It saves what you're watching and the layouts to your browser, and creates a sharable URL. An idea suggested by a friend, that I implemented in ~2 days.
