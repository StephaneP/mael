A website that allows people to join a room, and vote for a button to be pressed, that will be sent to an electron tray app running on a computer. Inspired by [Twitch Plays](https://blog.twitch.tv/en/2016/01/13/announcing-the-twitch-plays-game-category-55149935ad79/) where stream viewers have control over the streamed content.
