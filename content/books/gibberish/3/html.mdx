# HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. That sounds kind of complicated, but let's break the two complicated bits down - I'm assuming you know what a language is.

**Hypertext** - All this means is that it's text that is linked to other text somehow. You know the stuff you click on on webpages and it takes you to other pages? Those are hyperlinks, because they link the hypertext together.

**Markup** - This just means the language is a bunch of different snippets (also known as codes, and tags) that tell something how to display something.

HTML is pretty much just a way to write text that's linked together, with some extra bits to let something (a web browser most of the time) know how to display special bits and pieces.

A super simple HTML document looks something like this:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p style="font-weight: bold;">This is an example!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let's work through that.

The bits you see in the angled brackets (`<` `>` those things), like `<html>` are called _tags_ (remember that bit we talked about for the markup bit of HTML), and you'll see that there's pairs of them, with other ones between the two matching ones, like the matching `<html>...</html>` on the first and last line, the first one in the pair we call the _opening tag_ and the last one the _closing tag_. This is how most tags work, although some of the time you can see things called _self closing_, or _unclosed_ tags - we'll get more into those later, but they'll look something like this: `<div />`. You build up a HTML document by nesting HTML tags, with either more HTML tags inside them (closed or regular), or text. That's it, nothing special, the worst bit of HTML is knowing about the tags and what you can do with them. We'll dig into all that a bit now.

## Tags in the example

### `html`

This is always the outer tag, that you put everything else in. That's it.

### `head`

Generally the `html` will always have a `head` tag with stuff in and a `body` tag with stuff in, both on the same level (as in directly under the `html` tag). This one, the `head` tag is sort of the container for information about the page that you don't necessarily want to "show" in the browser, as in it's not the stuff you physically see, but it's stuff the browser needs to know about the page to show it. For example, the title of the page that it shows in the tab, along with a bunch of other stuff we'll cover later. If it's not a visible thing in html, it probably deserves to go in here most of the time.

### `title`

Hey, you know that bit I said about the title of the page? `title` is an oddly specific tag that lets you do that, the stuff between the opening and closing tag is what the browser will use as the title of the page. Nice and simple.

### `body`

I mentioned in the explanation about the `head` tag how it and `body` are kind of a pair, and that's cause while `head` is for the not visible stuff, `body` is for all the visible stuff, the things you see on the page. Most of the other html tags you'll use will go in here somewhere, nested in a bunch of ways.

## Commons tags and attributes

Okay, so there's a lot of different tags and each tag has its own list of attributes - but there's lots of common ones in there though, and you'll mainly only use a handful of each. We'll run through a bunch of the common tags and their common attributes, and then I'll give you some links to help you explore the rest when, and if, you need them.

### Common stuff to put in the `body`

#### `p`

Short for _paragraph_. Browsers use it to add a single blank line before and after each `p`. So something like this:

```html
<p>Line 1</p>
<p>Line 2</p>
```

Gets printed out by the browser like this:

```
Line 1

Line 2
```

Pretty straight forward. An important concept to introduce here though is that HTML ignores whitespace (spaces and line breaks (new lines)) and treats it all as a single space. So something like this:

```
<p>Line 1</p>
<p>Line 2 then a whole load of            spaces
and a new line</p>
```

Gets displayed like this:

```
Line 1

Line 2 then a whole load of spaces and a new line
```

#### `br`

But what about when you're inside a `p` tag and you want a new line? The difference here is you use multiple `p` tags for multiple paragraphs and breaking them up, but you use `br` to break up lines within a paragraph. `br` is a cool tag because it's one of those `unclosed` tags that we talked about earlier (though it's a special kind of weird cause it doesn't _need_ the `/` - get used to this, programming is full of things _mostly_ being consistent except when it's not). So a quick example:

```html
<p>Line 1<br />Line 2</p>
```

would be:

```
Line 1
Line 2
```

#### `b`, `strong`

#### `i`, `em`

#### `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`

#### `ul`, `ol`, and `li`

#### `a`

#### `input`

#### `select`, `option`

#### `button`

#### `form`

#### `span`

#### `div`

### Common stuff to put in the `head`

#### `style`

#### `link`

#### `script`
