This book is going to focus primarily on programming languages and approaches for modern web development, that is making the websites that you use on your phone and computer every day. But let's cover what makes up a website, before we even get into the code. This will serve as a really good foundation, giving some background to what we're going to talk about, and will help you see where bits fit in the bigger picture with much better context. There's a lot of moving parts to websites.

Mostly though we can split them up into 3 parts.

## 1 - The Frontend

We have the _frontend_, that is the stuff that you interact with in your browser, the buttons you click to like things, etc. It's concerned with all the interactivity that you can do, and the styling to make everything look nice. In runs inside the browser of the person viewing it. You'll see the term _client_ thrown around a lot when talking about websites, and generally clients are peoples connected devices and where the frontend runs.

## 2 - The Backend

Then we have the _backend_ these are the services that send the code making up the frontend to your browser, as well as handling getting all the data to show, such as the list of cute cat pictures, and who's liked them etc.

## 3 - The Infrastructure

The Backend code has to live somewhere, and run somewhere, similarily to how the frontend runs on peoples computers when they view websites. The _infrastructure_ is all the stuff required for the backend to run, so the _servers_ (pretty much just some other computers running somewhere connected to the internet with the code for the backend running on them), as well as databases (where the data, so the list of posts, likes, etc, lives).

At its most fundemental, all websites require these three parts in some form, though there's a lot of different ways to make each part.
